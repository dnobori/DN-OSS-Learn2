This directory contains a generic start/stop script that can be used on
most UNIX systems to automate control of the openarc filter.

To install, copy it to /etc/init.d/openarc, and ensure its mode is 0755.
Then, follow the section below appropriate to your system.  If you don't see
your system listed, we would appreciate receiving from you instructions
specific to your system once you get it working so that others who come
after you can have helpful instructions.

Please submit bug reports and feature requests to
openarc-users@lists.trustedomain.org or via the trackers on SourceForge.


RHEL-based and SLES-based Linux systems:

Execute "chkconfig --add openarc" as root.  This will read parameters found
in the script and set up symbolic links under /etc/rc.d so that the filter
is automatically started and stopped as needed.
